# Binary Puzzle - Teacher site

Details of the puzzle are on the home page:  https://bwattle.github.io/BinaryPuzzle/

Word instruction documents are at: http://techeducation.com.au/SDD/BinPuz/

This trial HSC question is a good example of:
    - top down programming
    - stubs
    - conversion from 1D to 2D arrays
    - code refinement - initial grunt code to neat nested loops
    - screen layout with minimal CSS
    - constantly updating version numbers and noting incremental changes

Solving the various puzzles is fun and the sandbox is built up version by version until there are 13 sample puzzles which are chosen from a drop down.

The home page (index file) links to the versions as evolve.

This version is 6x6, but enterprising students may want to code for variable sizes from 4x4 to 10x8.

Visual Studio is used as the editor with the GitHub extension so that pushing, pulling and syncing are automatic - from the "Git Changes" tab.

Zips of v1.05 & v1.08 can be downloaded from the home page at the link above.
